# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a web app designed to be used as a study guide for new web developers. It holds basic notes on major topics in web development that can be reviewed at anytime. This was my first project during a coding bootcamp and through this project I learned how to create a basic web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions.
